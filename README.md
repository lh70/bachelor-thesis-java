# s(ensor)-connect-scala
The repo contains a scala client to communicate with the s-connect-python MicroPython
framework.

Plans are:
1. reworking the message definitions (python, then port to scala)
2. porting the python management and graph-generation parts to scala
3. extend the message protocol for status info
4. (extend status info request for dynamic graph traversal, maybe snapshot?)
